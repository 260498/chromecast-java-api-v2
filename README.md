ChromeCast Java API v2
======================

At the moment I have started implementing this library, there was a java [implementation of V1 Google ChromeCast protocol](https://github.com/entertailion/Caster), which seems to be deprecated and does not work for newly created applications. The new V2 protocol is implemented by tools that come with Cast SDK, which is available for Android, iOS and Chrome Extension as javascript. Also there is a third party [implementation of V2 in Node.js](https://github.com/vincentbernat/nodecastor). This project is a third party implementation of Google ChromeCast V2 protocol in java.
